What Is Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)?
Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variable.

In essence, multiple regression is the extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression that involves more than one explanatory variable.
